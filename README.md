# vim-dzl-replace
<br>

![Usage Example](https://i.imgur.com/IaekVOL.gif)

A simple scope search and replace. Scope is defined by the indentation level.
For safety, you will be prompted for each replace.

### Basic Usage

There is a single command called like so.

`:ReplaceScope <toReplace> <replacedBy>`

<br>

`<leader>r <toReplace> <replacedBy>`

### Disclaimer: Not tried and tested

Should be fairly safe to use, however very few cases have been covered at this point.
