# vim-dzl-replace
<br>

![Usage Example](# "Nothing yet")

A simple scope search and replace. Scope is defined by the indentation level.
For safety, you will be prompted for each replace.

### Basic Usage

There is a single command called like so.

<code>
:ReplaceScope \(toReplace\) \(replacedBy\)
</code>

<code>
<leader>r \(toReplace\) \(replacedBy\)
</code>

### Disclaimer: Not tried and tested

Should be fairly safe to use, however very few cases have been covered at this point.
